<h1>Jack Vax</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in Virgina. During my junior and senior years I went to two different schools Briar Woods Highschool
and Academies of Loudon. Every other day I would go to Academies of Loudon to study graphic design and on the other days I
Would go to Briar Woods for my main classes. After I graduated I took a three month trip around europe which
helped me learn more about what I wanted to do. </p>
<p>I now live in Maryland with my mother and I go to Montgomery College studying <strong>game design</strong>. I also have five step 
siblings and two dogs. One of my favorite things to do is photography, every time I go on trips I take a ton of pictures and post them
on my Instagram. </p>
<p>I hope to become a game developer in the future. I would also love to <em>create my own mobile game</em>. However game design
isn't the thing I would love to do. I would love to study marine biology because I am fascinated with sea creatures. </p>
